-   Improving documentation on environment variables available for tweaking i.e the ports, and how/when to use them;

-   Improving documentation on usual issues;

** super important **

-   How to create a new preset ? a comprehensive step by step tutorial

```
@fabriciojs the idea was opening a shell within a container. But you're right, it looks better as a kool script rather than a kool command.

So based on the initial discussion here, I would say we need to at least address the ssh-ing in a container in our docs to suffice the original need @danielsuguimoto had in mind with a possible extra feature.

👍🏻 let's add that to our preset and to the documentation.
```

-   Add this details to the docs

-   troubleshooting for `kool self-update` on windows

-   Making the introduction more appelling to the reader. Perhaps using short gif animations?

    > -   What do I need in my computer to install kool ( Docker )

-   what is a completion script ?

-   Include a Full example and desired Output for each command

-   full lenght tutorial with Kool + Something ( Eg:. Get Started with Kool.dev and Wordpress in X minutes)

# Custom Resources

Most real-world web applications will go beyond just computing containers with your code — there's a vast myriad of other resources you will eventually need, like dedicated database services (i.e., RDS), replication, object storage (i.e., S3), CDN (i.e., CloudFront), just to name a few.

The Kool.dev Cloud team is ready to set it up for you when needed — providing you the Infrastructure-as-Code to live close to your application. While this is not built into our panel for self-service usage yet, you can just [contact us via email with your needs](mailto:contact@kool.dev), and we will work through your request.

## Bring Your Own Cloud

Important to notice - current cloud scenario is flexible enough where you can use Kool.dev Shared cloud, or hire a dedicated stack fully managed by Kool.dev, or even better - if you want total control and access we can set up the Kool.dev Cloud cluster and resources on your own AWS account. [Contact us](mailto:contact@kool.dev) to learn more about this possibility.

## Consulting

If you lack the DevOps expertise to determine your needs, we also have consulting services available to best serve you.

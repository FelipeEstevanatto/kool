Most real-world web applications will go beyond just computing containers with your code—there's a vast myriad of other resources you will eventually need, like dedicated database services (i.e., RDS), replication, object storage (i.e., S3), CDN (i.e., CloudFront), just to name a few.

The Kool.dev Cloud team is ready to set it up for you when needed—providing you the Infrastructure-as-Code to live close to your application. While this is not built into our panel for self-service usage, you can just [contact us via email with your needs](mailto:contact@kool.dev), and we will work through your request.

If you lack the DevOps expertise to determine your needs, we also have consulting services available to best serve you.

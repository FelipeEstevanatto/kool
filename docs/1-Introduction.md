From **development** to **production**, **kool** brings speed and security to software developers working with multiple tech stacks, making their development environments reproducible and easy to set up.

**kool** will help you:

* Stop installing different tech stacks on your local machine (e.g. PHP/Ruby/Python, MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL/MongoDB, NGINX/Apache, Redis/Memcached, Node, etc)
* Stop writing how-to documentation for setting up local development environments
* Eliminate "it works on my machine" problems caused by different versions / setups
* Maintain total control of each tech stack on every project
* Work locally using the very same tech stack and versions as your production environment
* Work the same way across different tech stacks and projects (e.g. Laravel, Symfony, Next.js, Nuxt.js, AdonisJs, NestJS, Hugo, WordPress, etc)
